          <h2>Friends</h2>
          <p>Friends are people we choose to spend time with because we enjoy their company, share similar interests or values, and often form deep emotional connections with them. Friends provide support, understanding, and companionship, and we typically trust them with personal matters.</p>

          <h2>Colleagues</h2>
          <p>Colleagues are individuals we work with in a professional setting. While we may have a good rapport with some colleagues and enjoy working together, the primary bond is based on shared professional goals and tasks. Colleagues may not necessarily have personal relationships outside of the workplace.</p>

          <h2>College or School Mates</h2>
          <p>College or school mates are classmates with whom we share educational experiences. While we may have some level of camaraderie with them due to shared classes or activities, the relationship tends to be more limited to academic or extracurricular contexts. College or school mates may not necessarily develop deep personal connections or continue their relationship beyond the educational environment.</p>
